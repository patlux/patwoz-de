  'Built the t-online news app with Expo at <a href="/work/stroeer">Stroeer</a>, including a custom Expo module for system theme detection and WebView synchronization.',
  'Set up EAS Build and automated releases for iOS and Android on the <a href="/work/stroeer">Stroeer</a> project.',
  'Maintained the React Native + Expo codebase for <a href="/work/kicker">Kicker</a>, powering offline playback, subscriptions, and a high-traffic streaming experience.',
