const intro =
  'I use Rust and Go to build high-performance backend services where reliability and speed matter. Both languages let me write safe, efficient code that scales.'

const delivered = [
  'Built a concurrent RSS importer in Rust for the <a href="/work/kicker">Kicker</a> platform, processing hundreds of podcast feeds with custom XML parsing (quick-xml), async streaming (tokio), and MySQL integration (sqlx).',
  'Developed the main backend API in Go for the FWMFL podcast app, handling payment processing (Stripe, Apple In-App Purchases, Google Play), user authentication (Auth0), and search indexing (Algolia).',
  'Implemented real-time Google Cloud Pub/Sub listeners in Go for processing Android subscription events and keeping user entitlements in sync.',
  'Created type-safe database queries using sqlc in Go and compile-time verified SQL with sqlx in Rust.',
  'Wrote Dockerfiles for multi-stage builds with optimized release profiles (LTO, single codegen unit) to minimize container image sizes.',
]

const why =
  'Rust and Go each shine in different areas. I pick Rust when I need zero-cost abstractions and memory safety for CPU-intensive data processing. Go works well for networked services where simplicity, fast compilation, and built-in concurrency make the codebase easy to maintain. Together they cover most backend needs without sacrificing performance or developer productivity.'
