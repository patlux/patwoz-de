When joining a new project I mostly see the usage of `react-native-svg` and in all of them there was no need to use it at all.

## SVG over PNG

What advantages has svg over png?

- One file
- Scalable without quality loss
- Coloring by `fill` and `stroke`
- SVGs can reduce bundle size, but this only holds if many SVGs are used, as library sizes also impact the total bundle.

What disadvantages?

- You need a extra library (probably two of them if you use `react-native-svg-transformer`)
- You have to maintain the library as dependency (That means it could also break when upgrading `react-native`!)
- Extra cost of runtime performance

# PNG over SVG

What advantages of using png over svg?

- No extra library. Displaying images are built-in into react-native
- The built-in `tintColor` property allows color adjustments without extra libraries.

What are the disadvantages?

- The image must be exported in 3 resolutions (1x, 2x, 3x), but this is straightforward in tools like Figma.
- Larger bundle size (But only if you exceed the size of the libraries)

## When to use `react-native-svg`

There is only one case where it is technically required to use `react-native-svg`: If you have to change `fill` and `stroke` at runtime and you don't know the colors at build time.

If you know the colors at build time, just create multiple versions of the image and you are just fine.

## When not to use `react-native-svg`

But if you have icons and images which are completly colored by just one color, just use `tintColor`.

```tsx
<Image tintColor="red" />
```

That's it! Thanks for reading!
