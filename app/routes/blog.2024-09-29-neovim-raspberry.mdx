Installing `neovim` on a Raspberry Pi using `apt` typically results in an outdated version like `0.7.2`. However, many modern setups like `lazyvim` require `neovim >=0.9`, making it essential to update.

This guide walks you through building and installing the latest version directly from the source.

## Build & Install

```sh
ssh <your-raspberry>

sudo apt install git cmake

cd ~/dev # or whereever you want
git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git
cd neovim
# For more see https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/BUILD.md
make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

# After a successful build, create a .deb package to install on your system.
cd build
cpack -G DEB

# Either
sudo dpkg -i nvim-linux64.deb

# or if you have neovim installed already
sudo apt remove neovim
sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite nvim-linux64.deb
```

Verify installation

```sh
$ nvim --version
NVIM v0.11.0-dev-862+gdf915f3af
Build type: Release
LuaJIT 2.1.1724512491
Run "nvim -V1 -v" for more info
```

You are done!

## Additional

Make sure you also have the following tools installed:

```ssh
sudo apt install fd-find ripgrep python3-pip
```
