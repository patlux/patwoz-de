The [zig](https://ziglang.org/) community is large, but the number of native zig libraries is still growing. However, you can easily import any C library into your zig project.

**Step 1: Fetch and Install the C Library**

First install the c library, we will use [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) as an example.

```sh
zig fetch --save=cjson https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

**Step 2: Modify build.zig to Include the C Library**

Now we need to adjust `build.zig` to import the library to our executable:

```zig
// ...
const cjsonDep = b.dependency("cjson", .{});
exe.addIncludePath(cjsonDep.path(""));
exe.linkLibC();
exe.addCSourceFiles(.{
    .root = .{
        .dependency = .{
            .dependency = cjsonDep,
            .sub_path = "",
        },
    },
    .files = &[_][]const u8{
        "cJSON.c",
    },
});
// ...
```

**Step 3: Use the C Library in Your zig Application**

Now, you can access the public API of `cJSON` in your zig application.

```zig
const c = @cImport({
    @cInclude("cJSON.h");
});

const value = c.cJSON_Parse(
    "{ \"name\": \"Patrick\" }",
);
defer std.c.free(value);
const name = c.cJSON_GetObjectItemCaseSensitive(
    value,
    "name",
);
defer std.c.free(name);
if (c.cJSON_IsString(name) == 1) {
    const str: [:0]u8 = std.mem.span(name.*.valuestring);
    std.debug.print(
        "name = {s}, len = {d}\n",
        .{
            str,
            str.len,
        },
    );
}
```

Output: 

```sh
> zig build run
name = Patrick, len = 7
```

With this approach, you can easily extend your Zig applications using the vast ecosystem of C libraries, like cJSON. This flexibility allows you to bridge the gap between Zig and C seamlessly.
