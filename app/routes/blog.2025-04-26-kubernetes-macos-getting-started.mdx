Kubernetes is incredibly powerful — and equally intimidating when you're starting out.  
When I first explored Kubernetes, I struggled to find a simple, structured path to getting it running on my development machine.  
This guide is what I wish I had back then.

> ⚠️ Prerequisite: You should already be comfortable with Docker and understand its basic concepts.

## Installing Kubernetes Locally

There are many tools for running Kubernetes locally — minikube, k3s, k0s, k3d, etc.  
For macOS, I recommend [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/), which offers [native Kubernetes support](https://docs.orbstack.dev/kubernetes/).

**Why Orbstack?**  
Orbstack automatically configures service DNS (`<service>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`), so you don't have to mess with `/etc/hosts` manually. This makes testing, debugging, and development much easier.

After installing Orbstack, start Kubernetes:

```sh
$ orb start k8s
```

> If `orb` isn't found, double-check your [Orbstack installation](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install).

Verify Kubernetes is running:

```sh
$ kubectl config get-contexts
CURRENT   NAME       CLUSTER    AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
*         orbstack   orbstack   orbstack
```

## Your First Deployment

If you've used [Podman](https://podman.io/), you're already familiar with Pods.  
In Kubernetes, Pods usually sit behind a higher-level abstraction: **Deployments**.

In Docker, you launch a container like this:

```sh
$ docker run nginx
```

In Kubernetes, you describe containers in YAML and apply the configuration with `kubectl`.

Create a file `example.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example-deployment # deployment name
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: example-pod # -----
  template:              #    |
    metadata:            #    |
      labels:            #    |
        app: example-pod # <--
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: example-container
          image: nginx
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: example-pod # selector which pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080 # exposed port
      targetPort: 80 # container port
```

Apply the configuration:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f example.yaml
deployment.apps/example created
service/example-service created
```

Check the deployment status:

```sh
$ kubectl get deployments --watch
NAME      READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
example   1/1     1            1
```

Wait until `READY` shows `1/1`.

Check the running pods:

```sh
$ kubectl get pods --watch
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-54c9b4c747-v7mbj   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

### Accessing Your Application

Your service is now reachable at:

[http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/](http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/)

You can also access it via its cluster IP:

```sh
$ kubectl get svc
NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP        EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
example-service   ClusterIP   192.168.194.207   <none>        8080/TCP   2s
```

> Note: Cluster IPs change after restarting services. DNS access via Orbstack remains stable.


### Cleaning Up

Delete your resources:

```sh
$ kubectl delete -f example.yaml
```

Verify pods are gone:

```sh
$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
```


### Understanding Kubernetes Layers

#### Level 1: Docker — Direct Container

```sh
docker run nginx  →  [ Container ]
```
- Single container, immediate run.

#### Level 2: Podman — Pod-Based Grouping

```sh
$ podman pod create --name mypod             →  [ Pod ]
$ podman run --pod mypod -p 8080:80 nginx    →     ├─ [ Container ]
$ podman run --pod mypod redis               →     └─ [ Container ]
```

- Multiple containers share a network namespace.

#### Level 3: Kubernetes — Declarative Deployment

```sh
YAML (Deployment) → kubectl apply → [ Deployment ]
                                        └─ [ Pod ]
                                             ├─ [ Container ]
                                             └─ [ Container ]
```

- Declarative infrastructure, automated scaling and healing.


### What Is a Deployment?

A `Deployment` in Kubernetes manages Pods, ensuring the desired number of replicas are always running.

You can scale your deployment by adding `replicas: 2` to your `example.yaml`:

```yaml
...
spec:
  replicas: 2
...
```

Apply changes:

```sh
$ kubectl apply -f example.yaml
```

List your pods:

```sh
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
example-deployment-779f6bb7dc-nvvq7   1/1     Running   0          4s
example-deployment-779f6bb7dc-wlfzg   1/1     Running   0          4s
```

Kubernetes will automatically distribute traffic between the two instances.

### What Is a Service?

A `Service` in Kubernetes provides a stable way to access one or more Pods.  
It assigns a **Cluster IP** (internal virtual IP) and a **DNS name** (e.g., `example-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) inside the cluster.

However, it's important to understand the difference between running Kubernetes in **k3d** (or any other tool) versus **Orbstack**:

#### k3d

- k3d runs Kubernetes inside a Docker container.
- The internal DNS names (`*.svc.cluster.local`) are only resolvable **inside the cluster** (between Pods).
- Your **host machine** (macOS) is **not part of the cluster's network**.
- As a result, you **cannot reach** `example-service.default.svc.cluster.local` directly from your Mac without special DNS routing or port-forwarding.
- Typical workarounds:
  - `kubectl port-forward`
  - Exposing services as `NodePort`
  - Setting up an Ingress controller

#### Orbstack

- Orbstack tightly integrates your host machine into the cluster network.
- It **automatically configures DNS** so that `.svc.cluster.local` names are **resolvable from your Mac**.
- You can directly open `http://example-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/` in your browser without any extra configuration.
- This makes development, debugging, and service access much simpler.

**Orbstack** gives you a much smoother local development experience by bridging the cluster and host DNS automatically, while **k3d** needs extra setup if you want to access services easily from your Mac.

## Conclusion

Setting up Kubernetes on macOS doesn't have to be painful.  

With Orbstack, a few YAML files, and some `kubectl` commands, you can be up and running fast — and focus on learning Kubernetes without unnecessary friction.

### What's Next?

Now that you have Kubernetes running locally and deployed your first app, here are some great next steps to deepen your knowledge:

- **Explore `kubectl` Commands**  
  Learn how to inspect Pods, Services, Deployments, and troubleshoot issues using `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, and `kubectl exec`.

- **Dive Into Helm**  
  Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. It helps you install complex applications easily.  
  👉 Recommended starting point: [Helm Quickstart Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)

- **Understand Ingress Controllers**  
  Move beyond ClusterIP and NodePort services by setting up an Ingress (like Traefik or NGINX) to manage external access to your apps.

- **Learn about StatefulSets, Jobs, and CronJobs**  
  Deploy workloads that require persistent storage or scheduled execution — not everything fits neatly into stateless Deployments.

- **Set Up Local CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Try integrating your Kubernetes setup with local GitOps tools like ArgoCD or simple CI pipelines that deploy automatically into your cluster.

- **Join the Community**  
  Engage with Kubernetes communities (Slack, Discord, CNCF meetups) to stay updated and ask questions when stuck.

Kubernetes has a steep learning curve — but with a solid local setup and consistent hands-on practice, you’ll progress faster than you think.

**Happy clustering! 🚀**
